PRIVACY POLICY: At Dance Sport and Motion, this privacy policy states that the Sport / Dance Motion App does not collect any user data.  Any apps developed by Cody Godines, only temporarily and locally uses video and gallery to aid the user in dance and sport choreography.  It does not send any personal data or gather personal data for third party use.

HELP:  HOW TO USE THE APP.  This app assumes you have a video/screen recording already on your phone that you would like to study.  Open a video with the file icon.  Use the timebar OR your fingers on the video, left and right, to determine a starting point.  Scrolling on the video adjust every 1/100th of a second!  It helps to be paused (center of video) when doing so.  Click the right arrow to set the start point.  Scroll forward to determine the end of your motion.  Click the left arrow to set the end point.  Now the video repeats and you can watch and learn easier!  Go to settings to slow down the repeating clip.  Have fun!
